This Project is related to the go based web-server where i ahve the mutex Package of golang to handle the requets and respons

use hello world and http server
then mutex


finding local hostname using details.go

i have alpine to light weight the image
debug conatiner image when docker is not able to build the immage go to the docker container.
docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app golang:1.20 bash
tip: in this remeber the i st stage go version should be same like your local version
tip: second stage of docker should match the match the binary arch of first stage

Note: minikube cretaet the kubernets cluster inside the docker not your system

To understnad the kubernetes service and deployement naming and service naming see the mentioned diagram

challenges:
1. Traffic is not coming up in kubernets and pods not coming up
soln: Your Computer’s Docker <-- separate from --> Minikube VM Docker (where Kubernetes runs)
switch your terminal to Minikube Docker and build your image inside it — so Kubernetes can use it directly.

kubectl port-forward service/web-service 8080:80- run this command to access i ton web

2. understnding the function based object 
handler := http.HandlerFunc(healthHandler)
    handler.ServeHTTP(rr, req)
	
3. capital letetr Problem 
Refactor your code into a package
Create a subdirectory (e.g., handler) and move your HealthHandler code into that package.
or create the separate file 


Testing learning:
1. name the file like main_test.go becoz go expect the suffix before _test.go
2.Look at your code function what parameter it had in the test code u need to use those parameter to do call the function
